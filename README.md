Created this planet simulation while waiting in line at Disneyland on my phone. No external libraries were used and relavant point particle kinematics and dynamics equations were implemented using JavaScript and the built-in canvas API. _No external libraries were used_. 

Form elements and some other touch-ups were added later on a computer. 

Computes gravitational force and consequently acceleration between two point particles. Thus, the values for mass must be very large to produce noticeable results (when using the universal gravitational constant).

Future additions may include adding an additional input to change the initial velocity vector of the "smaller" particle.
