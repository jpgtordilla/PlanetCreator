Created this planet simulation while waiting in line at Disneyland on my phone. Needless to say, debugging was quite challenging. 

Form elements and some other touch-ups were added later on a computer. 

Computes gravitational force and consequently acceleration between two point particles. Thus, the values for mass must be very large to produce noticeable results (when using the universal gravitational constant).

Future additions may include adding an additional input to change the initial velocity vector of the "smaller" particle.
