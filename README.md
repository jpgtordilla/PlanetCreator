Created this planet simulation while waiting in line at Disneyland on my phone. Needless to say, debugging was quite challenging. 

Form elements and some other touch-ups were added later on a computer. 

Computes gravitational force and consequently acceleration between two point particles. Thus, the values for mass must be very large to produce noticeable results (when using the universal gravitational constant).
